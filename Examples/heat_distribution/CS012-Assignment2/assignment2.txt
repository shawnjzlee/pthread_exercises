The temperature distribution in a thin metal plate with constant (or isothermal) temperatures on each side

can be modeled using a two-dimensional grid, as shown in the figure below. Typically, the number of

points in the grid are specified, as are the constant temperatures on four sides. The temperatures of the

interior points are usually initialized to zero, but they change according to the temperatures around them.

Assume that the temperature of an interior point can be computed as the average of the four adjacent

temperatures; the points shaded in the grid below represent the adjacent temperatures for the point

labeled x in the grid. Each time that the temperature of an interior point changes, the temperatures of

the points adjacent to it change. These changes continue until a thermal equilibrium is achieved and all

temperatures become constant.

Basic algorithm:

1. Get from the user the names of the input and output files.

2. Read from the input file the initial temps for top, right, bottom, and left sides of plate.

3. Read from the input file the tolerance for equilibrium.

4. Initialize the edges of the 2D grid with initial temps you got from the input file, and initialize the

inner cells of the grid to 0.0.

5. Continue updating temperature values within inner cells until equilibrium is reached.

6. Output to the output file the values of the inner cells of the grid after equilibrium obtained.

Step 5 details

? When updating the grid's temperatures always start at the top, left inner cell and update that row

before updating the row below it. So, the first cell to be updated will be grid[1][1], then grid[1][2],

and so on.

? Never change an edge cell's temperature.

? A cell's new temperature will always be the average of the 4 cells adjacent to it, the cells

immediately above, below, left, and right of the cell.

? You should update all inner cells of the entire grid, while always keeping track of the largest

difference between the old value and the new calculated value for a cell. Once you have

completely updated the grid, if your max difference is within the tolerance level, equilibrium has

been reached. You are done. Go ahead and output the temperatures in each cell of your grid. If

not, you need to update the entire grid again.

? You are required to use 2D arrays, NOT vectors, for this assignment.

? The grid dimensions will always be the same as the grid example above (6 X 8).

Input/Output File Specifications

Input and output file names come from the user. Ask for input file first.

Input File

The input file will have the 4 starting temps on one line, each separated by a space and the tolerance on

the second line.
